## Our Architectural Pillars

![PHIE Core Pillars](./assets/phie-pillars.png)

PHIE builds applied AI systems across four foundational pillars:

### 1. Knowledge Modeling & Structured Intelligence
Ontologies, knowledge graphs, semantic schemas, and domain-aware data modeling form the structural backbone of our systems.

### 2. Multimodal Generative AI
Voice, vision, language, and structured data unified through grounded generative architectures with human-in-the-loop workflows.

### 3. Reasoning & Contextual Intelligence
Graph inference, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), contextual decision logic, and domain-aware reasoning engines.

### 4. Decision Automation & Execution Systems
Compliance engines, forecasting pipelines, advisory orchestration, and execution-ready AI operations.

## Philosophy

We do not build isolated models.

We engineer **intelligent systems**.

Every PHIE platform is:
- Structured
- Grounded
- Explainable
- Execution-oriented
- Continuously improving

From structured insight to intelligent action.
